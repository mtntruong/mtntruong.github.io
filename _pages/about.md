He was born Vietnamese and is currently residing in South Korea for studying, but his Korean is poor.

He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Multimedia Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea. His research interests include model-based deep learning for image processing, image restoration, and computational imaging.

He is a neither bright nor diligent student, but he is happy to answer questions regarding his research. He can be reached via `pj50a35u4@mozmail.com` (this is a masked email address to fight bots, he will reply using his real email, sorry for the inconvenience).
